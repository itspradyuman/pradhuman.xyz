Hi, firstly I'm so glad you're here.

About this, umm, so I currently work as a Associate Software Engineer(boring) at Accenture, tbh I was never quiet into it and don't get me wrong I am still not into it, I just know how to copy like a pro.

Let's get to something which I am really into which is a noting stuff down only differnece is earlier I was doing all this in an empty whatsapp group now I will be getting myself humiliated publicaly  I always had a thing for Art and Minimalism. 

So good clean images, ufff, I had a good phase when I myself created a good load of clean images(best process), felt like therapy.

Apart from that you can visit the [Tags](/tags) section for specifics.
