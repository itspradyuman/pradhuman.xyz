Hi, firstly I'm so glad you're here.

I am from Sirohi, Rajasthan. Completed most of my studies in Rajasthan, Did my B.Tech in Computer Science from Sathyabama University.

Graduated in 2021, I am currently work as a Associate Software Engineer at Accenture, It's my Second year in the job, it has been quite a learning journey.

I am currently educating myself in Design, it's something I have been curious about for the longest of time.

I also have a good hobby of capturing images. Shameless shoutout to my Instagram, find link above.

Feel free to DM me on my socials if you wish to reach out. 

For any feedback/corrctions mail me at prad@pradhuman.xyz as I don't proof read stuff I upload here.
Apart from that you can visit the [Tags](/tags) section if in case you're looking for something specific.

Cheers! ðŸ˜„
