Well to be really honest I have been thinking about hosting on web since a very long time also to my surprise the .com domain was already taken. 
Very unusual. 
GoDaddy was asking me hell lot of money just for the brokerage, Daddy got some real issues. Domain purchase and property dealing are really getting aligned.

I am not here to tell you the technical reasons as to why I chose an xyz domain over some cliche one's, ohh I just told you one of the reasons. 

Here let me help you again with some insight that's not so pleasing, I would choose absurdism over seriousness, I've been enough serious over these years, where did it get me, your guess is as good as mine. Fucking nowhere.
Might as well try things in an unconventional way.


Thanks, Have a Great New Year Good Human.
