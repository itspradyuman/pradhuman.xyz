Let's start from the basics here, I want you to look around and point out first five things you see, okay, go.
Now observe those five things, turns out they all have this thing in common. a design conecpt. You will realize that their is a particular concept of design which was kept in mind while creating the said product.
Now in this writeup I am going to break down how Emotional Intelligence has a lot to with how good of a designer you're.

## Empathy
Now it's interesting how we don't often appreciate simple design for being simple. 
Design as such is very subjective to who's looking at it, the point being if the designer is creating a product whose target audience are kids 
then the designer's first step is to actually empathize with the kids world view, to visualize which look on the prodcut would make a child excited.

## Curiosity
Often times design is about creating something which has never been done yet. Adifferent style. A perspective which could never make itself mainstream.
A point of view which was differnt and unique and hence rare. 
It's about being curious enough to experiment different ideas or coming up with perspective which never have made it to the table.

> An idea that never was.
