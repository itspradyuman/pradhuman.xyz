Hello People,

We have come a long way, have you noticed how we have fast tracked our growth numbers in terms on basically everything.

Things that people couldn't dream off like not driving a car using fuel or the possibility that your watch
 could predict a possible heart attack minutes before you actually have one using your daily routine! Well isn't that absurd.

The sheer amount of projects that are under construction at the moment is too huge to fathom.
Did you ever thought we would ever be purchasing and logging onto some website using our Electronic wallets
 and not using the "Sign in using Google" button I guess not, but for some of you you might still be wondering "wait, what the heck when did that happen?"

 Let me entitle you with some information that you have missed out on.

Thanks for pulling through 
and as a gesture of good will I am going to leave with a heart warming playlist from spoitfy, 
i believe have a fine collection of songs that could take you on a trip down memory lane. i hope you enjoy every bit of it. 
want to suggest me a song, let me know on [twitter](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=4299291317&text=Hey%20Pradhuman,%20I%20was%20just%20wondering%20if%20you%20have%20heard%20the%20song) :)



Let's play some music...

bye bye
